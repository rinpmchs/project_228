In this project, we have collected and cleaned up a dataset of real court decisions under Article 228 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. With the help of regular expressions, manual markup, and models based on large language models (LLM), important characteristics were extracted: the type of punishment, the length, the mass of the substance, the presence of mitigating and aggravating circumstances, the gender of the accused, and others. Further, based on the data obtained, we performed visualization, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing to identify possible patterns in the imposition of punishments. The results showed that this approach can be useful for a deeper analysis of judicial practice and the identification of hidden patterns in decision-making.
